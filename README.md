# GTKCS webite

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Georgia Institute of Technology Korean Computer Scientist (GT KCS) website.


## Introduction

This repository houses the code for our organization's official website, developed to address the need for a centralized digital platform that offers up-to-date information to our club members and effectively promotes our club to external organizations, including potential sponsors.

## Motivation

The creation of the GT KCS website was driven by a strong motivation to overcome challenges and enhance the overall experience for our community. The key motivations behind this initiative include:

1. Bridging Information Gap

Recognizing the need for effective communication, we aim to bridge the information gap within our community. A centralized website provides a streamlined channel for disseminating crucial updates, event details, and other pertinent information to our club members. This ensures that everyone stays informed and engaged, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose.

2. Innovation and Technological Proficiency

As a community of computer scientists, embracing technological innovation is ingrained in our ethos. The development of the website using cutting-edge technologies such as Django Rest Framework and React.js not only aligns with our values but also showcases our proficiency in leveraging advanced tools to create impactful solutions.

3. Professionalism and External Impact

The GT KCS website, meticulously designed and regularly updated, enhances our organization's professionalism and credibility, reflecting our commitment to excellence. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of attracting sponsors who recognize the value of our dedication. Beyond our community, the website serves as a powerful tool to showcase our activities and achievements, attracting attention from potential sponsors and expanding our club's impact.

## Description

### Figma Prototype

We began our journey by creating a comprehensive prototype of the website using Figma. Explore our Figma prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/a7Y5R54AlNDmcG7zHNtHTz/webpage-design?type=design&node-id=3-4&t=XEcPpK40iMYaneqq-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4&mode=design).

### Technologies Used

Our website is built on a robust tech stack:

- **Backend Framework:** Django Rest Framework
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **Bundling Tool:** Vite

We opted for Vite to streamline our React development process due to its fast build times and efficient development workflow.

In addition, we chose to implement SCSS instead of traditional CSS, leveraging its enhanced readability and modular structure to elevate the styling of our website.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/estherpark514/KCSwebsite.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server.
   ```bash
   # Run backend server
   python manage.py runserver

   # Run frontend development server
   npm run dev
   ```

Now you can access the website locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
